# Project Analyze International Debt Statistics
Analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.  Answering the following questions:  The total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators? data provided by The World Bank, contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.
# Results:
In this project, we used SQL to explore the IDS dataset in Jupyter Notebook. Debt Statistics gave us a brief idea what problems each countries might work on, which can be further broken down into detail for research.
